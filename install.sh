The newer version is needed because older versions had a hard dependency on libopenscenegraph80, which is not available on Ubuntu 14.04. The choice was to either compile libopenscenegraph80, or simply switch to a newer version of APM Planner. Since compiling libopenscenegraph80 would introduce unnecesary complexities, it was decided to use the newest version of APM Planner.
